UAB Research Computing Documentation
====================================

.. important::

   The main documentation for UAB Research computing has been moved to `uabrc.github.io <uabrc.github.io>`__. Please visit there for up-to-date documentation

.. add short blurb about research computing here

UAB Research Computing (RC) is a group of IT and data scientists dedicated
technical support for researchers at UAB, specifically related to cloud and
cluster computing. The main resources run by UAB RC are the `Cheaha cluster
computing platform <rc.uab.edu>`__ and UAB Cloud (coming soon!). Both of these
resources are freely available to use by any researcher or instructor at UAB.

.. MKD: currently thinking we place and edit all TOC in index, but hide them from rendering on the actual page. They'll appear on the sidebar. Then we keep things on the mainpage to a minimum, like the CGDS docs, Only including quickstart information. Modelled after https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html
