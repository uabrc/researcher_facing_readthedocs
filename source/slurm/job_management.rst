Managing Jobs
=============

When jobs are submitted, users can monitor their status using Slurm commands.
Additionally, users can get information about completed jobs regarding their CPU
and memory usage during execution for planning future jobs. Both of these cases
should be a regular part of using Cheaha for users.

In case jobs were submitted by accident or the code was written incorrectly,
they can also be cancelled. 


Monitoring Jobs
---------------

Currently running jobs can be monitored using the ``squeue`` command.
