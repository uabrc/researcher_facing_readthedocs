UAB Research Computing Day
==========================

Research Computing Day is a dialog within the UAB research community about
leveraging the power of computers to grow the depth of our investigation into
the nature of the world that surrounds us. The annual event welcomes discussions
on science, engineering, the arts and humanities focused on the drive to open
new research frontiers with advances in technology.

Whether computers are used to increase the accuracy of a model, interpret the
ever-growing stream of data from new image collections and instruments, or
engage with peers around the globe, UAB's status as a leading research community
depends on the ability to incorporate these capabilities into the research
process. By participating in the dialog of Research Computing Day at UAB,
researchers can share how they are using these methods to enhance their
research, gain new insights from peers, and contribute their voices to the
growth of research at UAB. 

Background
----------

Since 2007, The `Office of the Vice President for Information Technology
