Managing UAB XIAS Users
=======================

UAB XIAS User management allow UAB faculty and staff to grant external collaborators access to specific resources on the internal UAB network. All XIAS users must be connected with at least one site, so you'll need to create one at the `UAB XIAS User Management Webpage <https://idm.uab.edu/cgi-cas/xrmi/sites>`_. All XIAS Users must also have an expiration date.

Adding Users
------------

Before adding users, have a list of user emails handy for the site you wish to add users to, as well as expiration dates for each user.

1. To start go to the `UAB XIAS User Management Webpage <https://idm.uab.edu/cgi-cas/xrmi/sites>`_.

Discovering and Managing Users
------------------------------

There are two ways to discover XIAS users you are currently sponsoring. The first is to search by email address. The second is to list all users associated with a site.

Discovering Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. To locate users by e-mail address: type their email into the "Locate specific user(s) by e-mail address" text field on the "Manage Users" page.

   .. figure:: ./images/xias_users_list_000.png
      :alt: Image showing UAB XIAS User Management Webpage. An email search has been performed using the text field and a table listing names and emails is present at the top of the page.

2. To manage users by site: select the site from the drop-down box and click the "List" button. The page will reload with a table containing name, email, and start and end dates. The end date is when the XIAS user registration expires. To change the end date for user(s), click the "Sel" checkbox next to their names, enter a date in the "Change end date for selected users to" text field, and click "Update".

Revoking User Privileges

*THIS INFORMATION IS PENDING TESTING*

Users cannot have their XIAS account deleted. However, privileges may be revoked. To revoke user privileges, follow the instructions for managing users by site. Update the desired user(s)' end date to a date earlier than the current date.

*If you need to urgently revoke privileges* please also notify UAB IT by emailing AskIT@uab.edu as soon as possible. Please be clear about what is needed and when.
