File Browser
===========================

OOD provides an web-based file browser for your files on Cheaha. In order to
access it, in the toolbar click ``Files > <dir>``, where ``<dir>`` is one of the
choices of your ``$USER_HOME``, ``$USER_SCRATCH``, or ``USER_DATA`` directories.
This will open up the following page:

This page has a few parts to it:

1. **Home directory (red):** A link to your ``$USER_HOME`` directory and all of
   its subdirectories for easier navigation. This is always ``$USER_HOME`` even
   if you chose ``$USER_DATA`` or ``$USER_SCRATCH`` to open. 

2. **Working directory (green):** The absolute path for the current directory
   you are in along with hyperlinks to the parent directories for easier
   navigation.

3. **File List (black):** A list of all file and folders in the working
   directory along with select information. Hidden files and file permissions
   can be shown using the radio button in Command Bar at the top right (orange).

4. **File Commands (blue):** A list of commands to perform to a file or
   directory.

.. note::

    Be careful deleting files here. They will be gone forever!

5. **User Commands (orange):** A list of commands for navigating in the file
   browser, file or folder creation, and opening a terminal.


User Commands
---------------------------


Uploading Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data can be uploaded from your local machine using this interface. Use the
``Upload`` button in the list of User Commands at the top right to select files
from your local browser. Additionally, you can drag and drop files from your
machine into the File List window as well.

This should be limited to small files only. For large files or datasets, please
use Globus instead.


Opening a Terminal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also open a bash terminal in the current directory using the ``>_Open in
Terminal`` command. This should only be used for small tasks when fine-grain
user control is necessary because the terminal is running on the login node. For
compute-intensive tasks, either request an interactive session in the terminal
or request an HPC Desktop session through the Interactive Apps and use the
terminal there.
