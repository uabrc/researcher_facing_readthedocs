Welcome to the Research Computing System

The Research Computing System (RCS) provides a framework for sharing data,
accessing compute power, and collaborating with peers on campus and around the
globe. Our goal is to construct a dynamic "network of services" that you can use
to organize your data, study it, and share outcomes.

The Research Computing System is designed to provide services to researchers in
three core areas:

- `Data Analysis` - using the High Performance Computing (HPC) fabric we call
  Cheaha for analyzing data and running simulations. Many applications are already
  available or you can install your own
- `Data Sharing` - supporting the trusted exchange of information using virtual
  data containers to spark new ideas
- `Application Development` - providing virtual machines and web-hosted
  development tools empowering you to serve others with your research 

Support and Development
-----------------------

The Research Computing System is developed and supported by UAB IT's Research
Computing Group. We are also developing a core set of applications to help you
to easily incorporate our services into your research processes and this
documentation collection to help you leverage the resources already available.
We follow the best practices of the Open Source community and develop the RCS
openly.

The Research Computing System is an out growth of the UABgrid pilot, launched in
September 2007 which has focused on demonstrating the utility of unlimited
analysis, storage, and application for research. RCS is being built on the same
technology foundations used by major cloud vendors and decades of distributed
systems computing research, technology that powered the last ten years of large
scale systems serving prominent national and international initiatives like the
`Open Science Grid`_, `XSEDE`_, the `LHC Computing Grid`_, and `NCIP`_.
