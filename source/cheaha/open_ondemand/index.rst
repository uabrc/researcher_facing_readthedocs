Open OnDemand
====================

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a user-friendly web interface for accessing Cheaha and
all of its associated software and tools without needing to manage a person VNC
session. It is currently the preferred method for accessing Cheaha at UAB.

OOD is available at `<https://rc.uab.edu>`__. Navigate there and authenticate with your
UAB credentials. Outside reseachers will need to use XIAS. If you do not have a
Cheaha account, you will be requested to make one.
