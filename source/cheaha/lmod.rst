Modules and Applications
========================

Most software available on Cheaha is installed as modules, managed by the Lmod
system. This document will provide a basic rundown of using Lmod commands to
customize a software environment. ``module`` is the main command used to
interface with module files in Lmod.


Listing and Searching Modules
-----------------------------

To begin, all module commands are run from the terminal. To know what software
is installed on Cheaha, use the ``avail`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    module avail

If you need to know what software is already loaded in your environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    module list

If there is specific software you want to search for, you can use the ``spider``
subcommand, and provide a string or regular expression to match against. All
modules containing the string (case-insensitive) or matching the regular
expression will be returned along with their installed versions.

.. code-block:: bash

    # list modules containing string
    module spider <string>

    # list modules matching a regular expression
    module -r spider <regex>

Loading Modules
---------------

To load modules, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    module load module1 module2 ...

.. note::
    If you only specify a module name without an accompanying version tag, the
    most recently installed version will be loaded into the workspace. If your
    scripts depend on specific versions of software being used, explicitly load
    the module version you need.

To unload packages, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    module unload package1 package2 ...

If you want to revert to the default modules, you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    module reset
