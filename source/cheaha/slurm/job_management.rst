Managing Jobs
=============

When jobs are submitted, users can monitor their status using Slurm commands.
Additionally, users can get information about completed jobs regarding their CPU
and memory usage during execution for planning future jobs. Both of these cases
should be a regular part of using Cheaha for users.

In case jobs were submitted by accident or the code was written incorrectly,
they can also be cancelled. 


Monitoring Jobs
---------------

Currently running jobs can be monitored using the ``squeue`` command. The basic
command to list all jobs for a specific user is:

.. code-block:: bash

    squeue -u $USER

The output of ``squeue`` will look like:

.. figure:: images/squeue_output.png
    :alt: SQUEUE output

This gives the job id, name, run time, partition, user, job status, and number
of nodes used for each job a user has submitted.

For array jobs, the job id will be formatted as ``jobid_arrayid``.

Further information about filtering by job name or partition, including
information about memory or number of CPUs, and info regarding messages specific
to a job's status can be seen using ``man squeue``.


Cancelling Jobs
---------------

Cancelling queued and currently running jobs can be done using the ``scancel``
command. Importantly, this will only cancel jobs that were initiated by the user
running the command. ``scancel`` is very flexible in how it behaves:

.. code-block:: bash

    # cancel a single job or an entire job array
    scancel <jobid>

    # cancel specific job array IDs, specified as single number or a range
    scancel <jobid_arrayid>

    # cancel all jobs on a partition for the user
    scancel -p <partition>

    # cancel all jobs for a user
    scancel -u $USER

Keep in mind, cancelling all jobs will also cancel the interactive jobs created
on the Open OnDemand portal.

More information on options to cancel jobs can be seen using ``man scancel``.


Reviewing Past Jobs
-------------------

If you are planning a new set of jobs and are estimating resource requests, it
is useful to review similar jobs that have already completed. To list past jobs
for a user, use the ``sacct`` command. 

Review With Job ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic form is to use ``-j`` along with a job ID to list information about
that job.

.. code-block:: bash

    sacct -j [jobid]

This command will output basic information such as the ID, Name, Partition,
Allocated CPUs, and State for the given job ID.

Jobs can have matching extern and/or batch job entries as well. These are not
especially helpful for most users. You can remove these entries using:

.. code-block:: bash

    sacct -j [jobid] | grep -wv -e extern -e batch


Review Jobs Submitted Between Specific Timepoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not remember the job ID, you can use the ``-S`` and ``-E`` flags to
retrieve jobs submitted between the given start datetime and end datetime. Valid
start/end time formats are:

.. code-block:: text

    HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM]
    MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY]
    MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS]
    YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]

Notes:

- Anything in ``[]`` is optional
- Times can be specified in either 12-hour with AM/PM or 24-hour
- For the last specification, the T itself is inserted, it is not replaced with
  any value. For example, requesting jobs starting after 12:30 PM on October 5,
  2021, the form would be ``2021-10-05T12:30``.

For example, to retrieve jobs submitted during the month of July 2021, the
command could be:

.. code-block::

    sacct -S 070121 -E 073121
    sacct -S 07/01/21 -E 07/31/21
    sacct -S 2021-07-01 -E 2021-07-31


Customizing the Output 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add ``-o`` with a list of output fields to customize the
information you see.

.. code-block:: bash

    sacct -j [jobid] -o jobid,start,end,state,alloccpu,reqmem

This command will output the job ID, the start time, end time, the state, the
number of allocated CPUs, and the requested memory for the specified job. All
potential output fields can be seen using ``sacct --helpformat``. Their
descriptions can be found on the `sacct documentation
<https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html>`__ under Job Accounting Fields.


.. _job-efficiency:

Evaluating Job Efficiency
-------------------------

It's important to evaluate the efficiency of your job in terms of resource usage
after it completes. Remember that Cheaha is a shared resource, so requesting
resources that sit unused during a job prevents others from using those
resources. As well, because each user has a maximum amount of resources they can
use at a given time, having inefficient jobs can increase analysis runtime
across many jobs. 

In order to look at job efficieny, use the ``seff`` command. 

.. code-block:: bash

    seff <jobid>

The output will look like:

.. figure:: images/seff_output.png
    :alt: SLURM Job Efficiency

The job had poor CPU efficiency, requesting 2 CPUs which were only busy for 30%
of runtime. It also had poor memory efficiency, using less than 1 GB total
memory of the requested 16 GB (5.73%). For subsequent jobs using a similar
analysis and dataset size, decreasing the requested memory and using a single
CPU would be appropriate.

.. note::

    Do not aim for 100% memory efficiency for a given job. Having a couple of GB
    extra is recommended to prevent jobs being cancelled due to insufficient resources.
