Cheaha User Guide
=================

Cheaha is a campus HPC resource dedicated to enhancing research computing
productivity at UAB. Cheaha is managed by UAB Information Technology's Research
Computing group (RC) and is available to members of the UAB community in need of
increased computational capacity. Cheaha supports high performance computing
(HPC) and high throughput computing (HTC) paradigms. Cheaha is composed of
resources that span data centers located in the new UAB Technology Innovation
Center and a commercial data center at DC BLOX in Birmingham. Research
Computing, in open collaboration with the campus research community, is leading
the design and development of these resources.

Cheaha provides users with both a web based interface, via open OnDemand, and a
traditional command-line interactive environment, via SSH. These interfaces
provide access to many scientific tools that can leverage a dedicated pool of
local compute resources via the SLURM batch scheduler. Cheaha and associated
storage has been assessed by external auditors, and passed a security assessment
for HIPAA alignment.

In addition UAB researchers also have access to regional and national HPC
resources such as Alabama Supercomputer Authority (ASA), XSEDE and Open Science
Grid (OSG).
