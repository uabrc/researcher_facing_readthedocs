Anaconda
========

Python is a high level programming language that is widely used in many branches
of science. The scientific python ecosystem is available to researchers as
Anaconda modules on Cheaha. Modules for both python 2 and python 3 are
installed. In order to see the different versions of each, use:

.. code-block::

    module spider Anaconda

Loading Anaconda
----------------

When planning a project, you should have an idea of which python version you
need to use. Python 3 is the current standard and is used by the Anaconda3
modules. After loading one of the modules, use ``python --version`` to check the
version number.

Anaconda modules and their corresponding python versions can be seen in the
table below:

.. csv-table:: Python Versions
    :file: conda-versions.csv
    :widths: 50,50
    :header-rows: 1
    :align: center

If a necessary version is not required, choose the most recent version, ``Anaconda3/2020.11``.

Libraries and Virtual Environments
----------------------------------

Anaconda virtual environments are self-contained environments with necessary
packages for specific projects. It is recommended to have a separate environment
for each project you have. This solves cases where different projects have
dependencies on different versions of the same package. 

New virtual environments include a few very common libraries such as
scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and scipy by default. However, most projects will
need to install some external libraries as well using ``pip`` or ``conda``.

Here, we will go through instructions for creating and managing Anaconda
environments including installing new libraries. More complete information on this process can be found at the
`Anaconda documentation
<https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#>`__.


Create an Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to create a basic environment with the default packages, use the
``conda create`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    # create a base environment. Replace <env> with an environment name
    conda create -n <env>

If you are trying to replicate a pipeline or analysis from another person, you
can also recreate an environment using a YAML file, if they have provided one.
To replicate an environment using a YAML file, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    # replicate an environment from a YAML file named env.yml
    conda create -n <env> -f <path/to/env.yml>

By default, all of your conda environments are stored in
``/home/<user>/.conda/envs``.

Activate an Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From here, you can activate the environment using either ``source`` or ``conda``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # activate the virtual environment using source
    source activate <env>

    # or using conda
    conda activate <env>

To know your environment has loaded, the command line should look like:

.. code-block:: text

    (<env>) [blazerid@c0XXX ~]$

Once the environment is activated, you are allowed to install whichever python
libraries you need for your analysis.

Install Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The base package manager for python is ``pip``. The basic way to use ``pip`` is
(replace <package> with the package name, omitting <>):

.. code-block:: bash

    # install most recent version of a package
    pip install <package>

    # install a specific version
    pip install <package>==version

    # install a list of pacakges from a text file
    pip install -r packages.txt

``pip`` searches various package indexes like `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`__ or
local project directories. If the package you need isn't found there, it may be
available in an online Anaconda channel (same as index). To install from there,
use the ``conda install`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    # install most recent version of a package
    conda install <package>

    # install a specific version
    conda install <package>=version

    # install from a specific conda channel
    conda install -c <channel> <package>

Generally, if a package needs to be downloaded from a specific conda channel, it
will mention that in its installation instructions.

Running Command-Line Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python code can be run an individual commands from the command line. In order to
access a python terminal, use the ``python`` or ``python3`` command in the
terminal window. The prompt will be replaced with ``>>>``. Execute any
commands here. ``exit()`` will return you to the normal command line.

Executing scripts is the more common use case than executing individual commands
interactively. To execute a script from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    python <script.py>

Any optional inputs the script has can be listed after the name of the script.

.. note::

    When Anaconda3 is loaded in your environment, the ``python`` and ``python3``
    commands both refer to Python version 3.X.X (whatever minor version is
    loaded). However, when Anaconda3 is not loaded, ``python`` will refer to the
    base Python 2.7.5 instead. Be sure to load Anaconda3 before running
    ``python``, or always use ``python3`` for disambiguation.


Deactivating an Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An environment can be deactivated using either ``source`` or ``conda``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Using source
    source deactivate

    # Using conda
    conda deactivate

Anaconda may say that using ``source deactivate`` is deprecated, but environment
will still be deactivated.

Closing the terminal will also close out the environment.


Exporting an Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To easily share environments with other researchers or replicate it on a new
machine, it is useful to create an environment YAML file. You can do this using:

.. code-block:: bash

    # activate the environment if it is not active already
    conda activate <env>

    # export the environment to a YAML file
    conda env export > env.yml
